# RLnet
Obsidian markdown notes on everything related to Reinforcement Learning

### What this is about
This is my attempt to create a "Second Brain" on Reinforcement Learning using Obsidian. I haven't seen many people doing this, and so I decided to make my own version and allow people to see it.

### Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/ei5uke/RLnet.git
cd RLnet/notes
```
