Obsidian markdown notes on everything related to Reinforcement Learning

### What this is about
This is my attempt to create a "Second Brain" on Reinforcement Learning using Obsidian. I haven't seen many people doing this, and so I decided to make my own version and allow people to see it.
\
I will be closely following the Sutton & Barto Book's information, but I will separate information more thoroughly instead of clumping it up into general chapters. Thus, I will be following more of a Wikipedia-like format instead of a textbook format, and ideally, each note is as concise as possible.

NOTE: This is still in production as I have yet to finish reading the entire RL book, so I will keep adding on steadily as I progress.

### Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/ei5uke/RLnet.git
## then open this repo as a vault in Obsidian
```
